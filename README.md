 # ***Dropdown menu***


## Description 📕
This project consists of the realisation of a drop-down menu in which you will see several buttons that can be clicked and will have an animation when they are displayed.

## Usage 👨🏽‍💻
You can use this project to access the social networks of the website or person quickly and in a visually dynamic way. If you want you can also use it to access an external link of another kind, but for that you will have to change the code and the images (logos) that appear in the buttons.

## Contributing 🤝🏼
You are free to modify it as you like and adapt it to your needs. You can also if you simply want to start from a ready-made base and make aesthetic changes to it.

## Installation 💻📦
You can use this project as long as you have a code editor or IDE that supports HTML, CSS and Javascript. If you do not have an editor or integrated development environment (IDE) you will need to download and install it. There is a link below where you will find a tutorial for Visual Studio Code, a free and widely used code editor thanks to the large number of extensions it has.

:::warning
Remind that the editor or IDE you download must support HTML, CCS and Javascript languages.

## Highlights
The most interesting part of the code would be the animations that the icons perform, the way in which by using the z-index they are hidden behind the menu and the child system to be able to work more easily with each icon.

## Extra information
I made the README using the HackMD website but it only let me export it as html or pure html to display it as I wanted it to   be displayed. This README file is the result of exporting what I made in the page to Markdown language. I put a link to the page so you can check how it should look. https://hackmd.io/@carhermora/HkgF-Ko6o
